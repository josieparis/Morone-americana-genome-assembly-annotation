### Access to the genome assemblies:

The genome assemblies for the male and female white perch are available on the ENA under XXX

NB: The ENA upload also includes the raw PacBio HiFi data

### Access to the genome annotations:

The genome annotations were performed using GALBA (https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/GALBA) and was cleaned using gfacs (https://gfacs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

Annotations can be found in the folders 'fale genome annotation' and 'female genome annotation' and include the following files:
